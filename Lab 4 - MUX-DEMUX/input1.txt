FRODO: "I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened."
GANDALF: "So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In which case, you were also meant to have it.
And that is an encouraging thought."
[They walk in silence for a moment. Frodo looks down at the Ring in his palm.]
GANDALF (softly): “Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.”
