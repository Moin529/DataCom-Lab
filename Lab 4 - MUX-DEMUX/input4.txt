In the age of digital transformation, data communication plays a crucial role in connecting devices, systems, and people across vast distances. Whether through the internet, local area networks, or cellular infrastructure, the ability to transmit and receive data reliably and efficiently underpins virtually all aspects of modern life. Techniques such as multiplexing, including synchronous and statistical time division multiplexing (TDM), enable multiple data streams to share a single channel, optimizing bandwidth and reducing latency. Understanding these technologies is essential for engineers and computer scientists who aim to build scalable and resilient communication systems for the future.
